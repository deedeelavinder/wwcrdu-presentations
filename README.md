These slides will be published [here](https://elstamey.github.io/wwcrdu-presentations/speaker_workshop.html)

To work on these locally, first install cleaver:

  > npm install -g cleaver


Edit the base markdown file for your deck, and to preview changes:

  > cleaver watch [filename.md]

Then open the file generated in your address bar using a url like `file:///C:/Users/....` 

Cleaver has a minimum theme and we can revise those themes or add styles using `basic_style.css` or another css file imported to the base markdown file.  But keep in mind your changes to the basic_style.css will affect other presentations.
